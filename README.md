# Anthromadness ANA Post

## Overview

This project applies data analytics, statistics, and visualization techniques to anthropological and population genetics research. Specifically, it explores the proposed **Ancestral North African (ANA)** genetic component.

## Key Goals of This Project

- **Generate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots** to visualize population clustering.
- **Construct a dendrogram** to analyze phylogenetic relationships.
- **Simulate an Ancestral North African (ANA) genetic component** and analyze its unique qualities.
- **Create interactive bar charts** to illustrate ancestry proportions.
- **Generate results in R** using linear algebra and Euclidean distance metrics.

## Technical Implementation

This project was developed using **R** with the following packages:

```r
library(ggplot2)       # For PCA and bar chart visualization
library(ggrepel)       # Improves label placement on PCA plots
library(ggdendro)      # Constructs dendrograms from hierarchical clustering
library(ape)           # Advanced phylogenetic tree analysis
library(data.table)    # Efficient data handling for large CSV files
library(tidyr)         # Data manipulation and transformation
library(dplyr)         # Data wrangling and filtering
library(plotly)        # Converts static plots into interactive visualizations
library(htmlwidgets)   # Saves interactive visualizations as HTML files
library(reshape2)      # Reshapes datasets for visualization
```

## How to Use

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Awale-Abdi/Anthromadness_ANA_post.git
cd Anthromadness_ANA_post
```
### 2. Have the Datasets present in your working directory

The analyses rely on **Eurogenes Global25 PCA coordinates** and custom data processing:

- 1_First_PCA.txt → Needed for generatingthe first global PCA I shared on my blog
- 2_PCA_Bar_Chart.txt → Needed for generating the SSA-to-Eurasian ancestry proportion bar chart
- 3_PCA_Global_Simulation.txt → Needed for generating the global PCAs containing the ANA simulations
- 4_PCA_ANA_Simulation.txt → Needed for generating my ANA simulations
- 6_PCA_Dendro.txt → Needed for the Dendrogram
- 7_MENA_ANA_proportions.csv → Needed for generating the MENA ANA admixture chart
  
You must have all these files present in your working directory for the R scripts to run without errors. They are loaded via relative paths, so as long as they are in the correct location, everything should work fine.

### **3. Run the R Scripts**
Make sure you have R installed and the required packages. Download the datasets into your working directory then open RStudio and execute the scripts:

- 1_First PCA Generation.R → Generates first global PCA in my blog post
- 2_SSA-Eurasian Bar Chart Generation.R → Generates SSA:Eurasian ancestry chart
- 3_Simulation PCA Generation.R → Generate Global PCAs with ANA simulations in them
- 4_ANA Simulation Generation - 63.5 percent Natufian.R → Generates coords of Natufian-like ANA simulation
- 4_ANA Simulation Generation.R → Generates coords of my computed ANA simulation discussed on blog
- 6_Dendrogram Generation.R → Generates Dendrogram
- 7_MENA Ancestry Proportions Bar Chart Generation.R → Generates MENA ANA admixture chart
